    "There’s a lot of recurrent discussion on the right tool to use for statistics and machine learning. `R` and `Python` are often considered alternatives: they are both good for statistics and machine learning tasks. But which one is the fastest? For a benchmark, it is relatively hard to make it fair: the speed of execution may well depend on the code, or the speed of the different libraries used. We decide to do classification on the Iris dataset. It is a relatively easy Machine Learning project, which seems to make for a fair comparison. We use the commonly used libraries in both `R` and `Python`. The following steps are executed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read a csv file with the iris data.\n",
    "2. Randomly split the data in 80% training data and 20% test data.\n",
    "3. Fit a number of models (logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbors, and support vector machines) on the training data using built-in grid-search and cross-validation methods\n",
